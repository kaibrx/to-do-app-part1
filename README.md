# to-do-app-part 1#
This exercise introcuded me to DOM events. In this project I created a simple to do app where I: 

> * Undertood DOM Events and how they enable interactive web pages and web apps
> * Analyze and determine which Events are most appropiate for the current situation
> * Create and use custom Even Listeners and methods
> * Recognize and use common ES6 features like cont, let, and arrow functions
